# FridgeBoard

Fridgeboard is a note taking browser application. Notes are labeled as magnets, going with the idea of the application being a fridge.

The application was built using Angular for front end and Slim for the API. It's a file based application, meaning that it does not require a database and data is hosted in JSON files, managed by the API.

## Installation
Install Front end libraries:

```bash
npm install
```

Install API libraries:
```bash
cd src/API
composer install
```
